<div class="para">A device or energy source which provides voltage or current in the circuit is known as power source. It is of two types. A device whose power is independent on the other element/s of the circuit is known as independent source, otherwise it is a dependent source. Typically independent sources are of two terminal devices and dependent sources are of four terminal devices. The dependent sources are also known as controlled sources. A controlled current source can be controlled by current or voltage in the circuit, similarly controlled voltage source can also be controlled by current or voltage in the circuit. The circuit symbols of some of the components are given here.</div>
