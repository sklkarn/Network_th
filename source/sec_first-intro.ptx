  <title>Linear and Non-linear circuit:</title>

  <introduction>
      <p>
      Circuit whose elements follow Ohm's law or has linear relationship 
      between current and voltage is known as linear circuit, otherwise it is a non-linear circuit.

<subsection xml:id="subsec-power_sources">
  <title>Independent and Dependent power sources:</title>
  <p>
    A device or energy source which provides voltage or current in the circuit is 
    known as power source. It is of two types. A device whose power is independent 
    on the other element/s of the circuit is known as independent source, otherwise 
    it is a dependent source. Typically independent sources are of two terminal devices 
    and dependent sources are of four terminal devices. The dependent sources are also 
    known as controlled sources. A controlled current source can be controlled by current 
    or voltage in the circuit, similarly controlled voltage source can also be controlled by 
    current or voltage in the circuit. The circuit symbols of some of the components are given here.

   <term> Note:</term> It is considered that an ideal voltage source has a negligible 
   internal resistance and an ideal current source has an infinite internal resistance. 
   Ideal voltmeter has an infinite internal resistance and ideal ammeter has a negligible 
   internal resistance.

    <title>Superposition Theorem:</title>
    <p>
     It states that total voltage drop at an element of the circuit or total current through 
     an element of the  circuit is the algebraic sum of the voltages across (or currents through) 
     this element due to individual sources as if they were acting on it independently. 
     Superposition theorem will be helpful when more than one type of sources are acting in 
     a linear circuit.

      <em>It is useful to convert current source into voltage source and vice a versa 
      sometime to solve the complex circuit</em>. Thevenin's logic can be applied to 
      the voltage source with a resistor in series and Norton's logic can be 
      applied to the current source with a resistor in parallel to convert 
      from one another. They are interchangeable.

    It states that in a linear and bilateral circuit the current due to a single independent source 
    in any particular branch of circuit is equal to the  current in the original branch where the 
    source was placed when the source is shifted to that particular branch of circuit. In other words,
